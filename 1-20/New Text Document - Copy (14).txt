My grandfather fought in World War II.
My grandmother was a nurse in World War II.
Today is November 11th.
Today is Remembrance Day.
Today we celebrate soldiers.
Everyone wears a poppy.
Poppies are red flowers.
Poppies remind me of my grandparents.
Poppies remind me of their sacrifice.
At 11 A.M, there are two minutes of silence.
People remember their friends and family.
People recite the poem "In Flanders Field".
It is a sad poem.
It helps us remember.
Today we wish for peace in the world.
