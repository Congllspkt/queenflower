The leaves are changing colors.
I see red maple leaves.
I see orange maple leaves.
I see yellow maple leaves.
The leaves are beautiful.
It is starting to get cold.
The wind is strong.
Winter is coming.
The leaves fall off the trees.
On Saturday we will clean them up.
The whole family helps.
My dad gets the rake.
My mom gets the garbage bags.
My brother and I help too.
We gather leaves with our hands.
We make a big pile.
My brother and I jump in the leaves.
We make a big mess.
Our parents don't mind.
Our parents fill our coats with leaves.
We look really big.
Everyone laughs.
Play time is over.
Back to work.
