Every family that I know has at least one car.
Some families have two, or even three cars.
Most people get their licence to drive when they are sixteen.
In my house, we just have one car.
If my father takes the car to work, my mother will take the bus.
I ride in a school bus to school.
My sister works in another town.
She gets on the train to go to work.
The train station is not far from my house.
The train tracks run right by my house.
My grandfather from Ireland comes to visit us.
He came over by boat.
He had to cross the ocean.
We went to Florida last year.
We flew on a plane.
The plane flew right through the clouds.
My friend's brother drives a motorcycle.
He wears a helmet.
I rode on his motorcycle once.
I had to sit on the back and hold on tight.
I ride my bicycle when the weather is nice.
I also have a scooter that I use to travel around.
I took a helicopter ride once.
The helicopter's propellers were going around when I got on.
I went straight up in the air.
I enjoyed the ride.
I would like to learn how to fly a plane or a helicopter.
I like flying through the air.
