It is fun to take a trip to a faraway place.
My brother just went to Italy and France.
He got on a plane at Toronto Airport.
He took a flight to France.
He stayed there for a couple of days.
He visited the Eiffel Tower.
He was in Paris.
He said that he enjoyed the food in France.
He then traveled to Italy.
He saw many towns and villages in Italy.
He went to Rome and visited many of the tourist attractions.
In Venice, he saw the canals.
He tried to speak Italian, but he is not too good at it.
He said that the people were very helpful.
They tried to understand him.
He bought souvenirs for us when he was in Italy.
He ate Italian food.
He said that pizza in Italy is quite different from the pizza we eat here in Canada.
He saw many streets that were made of cobblestones.
He saw many old buildings.
A lot of people in Italy travel around on scooters.
He stayed at a very nice hotel in Italy.
He was sorry when it was time to come home.
My brother likes to travel.
He likes to fly in airplanes.
The airlines lost his luggage once.
He was not too pleased about that.
Next year, he would like to travel to England.
